## What Changes Are Required

This template is a minimal template and is more focused on getting the gateway working. 

You may have to make the following changes-
1. These values are hard-coded in the `main.js`. Instead you may want to read it from the user input.
```js
// You may want to accept these values from user or pass through the order
const userInputValues = {
  amount: 1,
  name: 'Saurabh Daware',
  email: 'saurabhdaware99@gmail.com',
  contact: '9876543210'
}
```

2. Add your company name, logo, and brand color in `options` variable.
3. [Go Live!](#going-live)

## Going Live

Make sure you change the keys before going live-

- In `backend/.env`, replace keys with the Live Keys.
- In `frontend/main.js`, replace key in `RAZORPAY_API_KEY_ID` variable with Key ID.
